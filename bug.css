The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations. However, there's a common error where spaces are added inconsistently around the operators. For example, `width: calc(100% - 10px)` is valid, but `width:calc(100% -10px)` or `width: calc(100%-10px)` will result in unexpected behavior or errors.  Another issue occurs when using nested `calc()` functions without proper parentheses.  For example, `height: calc(calc(50% - 10px) * 2)` is incorrect and should be `height: calc((50% - 10px) * 2)`.
